# Hi there! I'm Ewa
I am a web developer, who loves continuously developing herself and putting the newly aquired skills to work. In my recent job I had an oportunity to get to know IT industry from different sides - I've been fixing and upgrading computers, setting up networks, designing marketing materials, creating websites (static and based on WordPress), providing support and implementing software solutions in local companies. While the last couple of years were an amazing journey for me, now **I would like to focus solely on the front-end development, which had always given me the most joy and satisfaction**.

I finished **postgraduate studies on Computer Programming at the West Pomerian University of Technology in Szczecin**, where I was learning Python and fundamentals of Computer Science. Part of the last semester was focused on Web Development (HTML, CSS and Bootstrap). Currently I am working on **Front-End Web Developer nanodegree program at Udacity**, where I am getting familiar with JavaScript and the DOM, Webpack, npm, Express.js and working with APIs.

In my free time I am learning German!

**Current skillset: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Webpack, NPM, Express.js, Bootstrap, Python, RWD, Git**
